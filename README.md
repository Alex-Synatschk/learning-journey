Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the PC Technician II position at Lone Star College. I recently graduated with honors from San Jacinto College with an Associates of Applied Science in Application Programming.

While my degree focused on programming, I have strong technical troubleshooting skills and experience working with various operating systems, hardware, and software applications. I am eager to support students and faculty with technical issues while continuing to develop my IT skills.

As a recent community college graduate myself, I understand the importance of reliable technology for student success and would bring both technical knowledge and patience to this role.

I appreciate your consideration.
